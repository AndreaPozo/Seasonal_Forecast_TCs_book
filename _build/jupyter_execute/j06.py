**After analizing the tailor-made predictor along the hindcast data for the calibration period (1982-2019), the performace of the model will be validated for year 2020, which has not been included in the predictor calibration process.**

**Steps:**
<br>  
    
 * **1.** Download and preprocess (file conversion and resolution interpolation) SST and MLD data for the validation time period.
 * **2.** Generation of the index predictor based on the index function obtained at the calibration period.
 * **3.** The fitted Principal Component Analysis for the calibration is used to predict the index principal components in that same temporal-spatial space.
 * **4.** The predicted PCs are assigned to the best match unit group from the fitted K-means clustering -> based on the index predictor a DWT is assigned to each day.
 * **5.** From the DWT the expected mean number of TCs in 3x3ยบ cells map in the target area is known and the monthly aggregated maps are generated.

**The model generally performs well when estimating the expected TC activity and intensity.**
<br>
    
**However rather than reproducing exactly the historical TCs tracks it shows higher number of expected TCs in the TC path and also in the surroundings -> overstimation (January).**
<br>
    
**When a TC is very intense or very close in dates to the previous or following month it leaves its footprint (Harold 1/04 in March).**
