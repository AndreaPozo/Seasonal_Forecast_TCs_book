**After building and validating the model it will be applied to forecast TCs seasons from previous years to validate this data.**
<br>

**The forecasts from the first day of August, September, October and November. There are four runs per day of the model (00:00,06:00,12:00,18:00 hours).**

**Steps:**
<br>  
    
 * **1.** Download <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/climate-forecast-system/access/operational-9-month-forecast/time-series/" target="_blank">from CFS 9-month operational forecast</a> and preprocess (file conversion and resolution interpolation) SST and MLD data.
 * **2.** Generation of the index predictor based on the index function obtained at the calibration period.
 * **3.** The fitted Principal Component Analysis for the calibration is used to predict the index principal components in that same temporal-spatial space.
 * **4.** The predicted PCs are assigned to the best match unit group from the fitted K-means clustering -> based on the index predictor a DWT is assigned to each day.
 * **5.** From the DWT the expected mean number of TCs in 8x8ยบ cells map in the target area is known and the monthly aggregated maps are generated.

**Recall**:
<br>
    
* The model generally performs well when estimating the expected TC activity and intensity.   
* However rather than reproducing exactly the historical TCs tracks it shows higher number of expected TCs in the TC path and also in the surroundings (overstimation)
* In puntctual cases where the number of historical TC tracks in a cell is greater than 3 there is an understimation.
* When a TC is very intense or very close in dates to the previous or following month it leaves its footprint.
<br>
<br>
    
**Forecast data**:
* Much greater uncertainty -> DWTs probability is greatly shared and therefore more extended predictand maps.
* The weakness of the model are enhanced.
<br>
    
**Although the model has been proven to perform very well, the accuracy and reliability of the forecast greatly depends of the quality of the forecast data, which has also been proven to be quite improvable.**
